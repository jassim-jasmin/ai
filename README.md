# ai
This is an experimental repo for exploring ai applications. It includes my study and way of approach.

`ml` includes the final alogorithm implementation. Tried to written for reuse.

`other` it's a messy unstructured content. It's my pure experiments.

Trying to restructure the repo after each successfull expriment.
