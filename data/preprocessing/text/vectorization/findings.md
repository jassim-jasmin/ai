## N-grams
N-grams of texts are extensively used in text mining and natural language processing tasks. 
They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given window and 
when computing the n-grams you typically move one word forward 
(although you can move X words forward in more advanced scenarios)



##TF-IDF
- TF (Term Frequency)
- IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)
- TFIDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) * IDF(d)
